## What is SAMLING

SAMLING is a Serverless (as-in client side only) SAML IdP for the purpose of testing SAML integrations.

It provides control over the SAML response properties to send back to the Service Provider in response to a SAML request,
including simulating errors and specifying session cookie duration to track the logged-in user.

If there is a <strong>SAMLRequest</strong> query parameter present with an `AuthnRequest`,
SAMLING will auto populate some of the fields in the `SAML Response Properties` section in preparation for creating the SAML response.

If there is a <strong>SAMLRequest</strong> query parameter present with a `LogoutRequest`,
SAMLING will log out the currently logged-in user.

Generating a SAML Response requires the use of a private key and certificate for signing the SAML Assertion.
SAMLING enables to generate a random private/public key and to save them in the local storage so they are used in
subsequent SAML responses.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/capriza/samling.git
cd samling
npm install
npm run build
```

You'll end up with a `public` directory with all the required assets for loading `samling.html`.

## How to Use

1. Open up `https://zliau.github.io/samling/samling.html`. You'll land on the **SAML Response Properties** section.
2. Fill in the required properties fields. Required fields are marked with an asterisks (*).
   * `Name Identifier` - the user name
   * `Callback URL` - where to send the SAML response
   * `Private Key` -  the private key to use for siging the SAML assertion
   * `Public Certificate` - the public certificate to embed in the SALM response
   * `New Pair` - generate a new private/public key pair
   * `Save` - save the private key and public certificate to the local storage so that they are automatically loaded on re-visits.
3. Click on **Create Response**. You will be be taken the **SAML Response** section.
4. Review the SAML response and set the session duration, then click on **Post Response**. At this point a session cookie
   is created for the logged in user.
5. You can reload the samling page and go to the **User Details** page to verify the session cookie was created.
